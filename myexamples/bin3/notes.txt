restarts now should work plan:
-r 
 flag means restart and continue from last data dump output
 that means we remove end of output files and write over them
 keep the same froot 
 restart_froot is not used
 continue in time

you want to use the same parameter file but increase the tmax

-s 
 means use an restart_froot string that is given in parm file to load in 
 the masses and springs and indices from the _run file
 this uses restart_froot which is listed in parm file
 set the time to zero and run with parameters in the parm file
 with the new froot from the parm file on command line
 no _run file is created, you need to use the old one!


a1 is the one that I temporarily put in the draft
