restarts now should work plan:
-r 
 flag means restart and continue from last data dump output
 that means we remove end of output files and write over them
 keep the same froot 
 restart_froot is not used
 continue in time

you want to use the same parameter file but increase the tmax

-s 
 means use an restart_froot string that is given in parm file to load in 
 the masses and springs and indices from the _run file
 this uses restart_froot which is listed in parm file
 set the time to zero and run with parameters in the parm file
 with the new froot from the parm file on command line
 no _run file is created, you need to use the old one!


a1 is the one that I temporarily put in the draft   seed=1
b1 is the one that I temporarily put in the draft   seed=4
both are run to 4e5 and have backups at 2e5

b1a is restarted from b1 with -s drift in
  forgot to turn off tidal evolution
  eccentricity does slowly go up in this simulation
  migration is too slow

b1b is restarted from b1.    spin down of primary
  turned off damping in bodies
  dull until I maybe reaches a 2:1 spin spin resonance.


b1c is restarted from b1 -s drift in
  low damping, drift in of semi-major
  this one is interesting as there is an obliquity jump at about a_B 2.3 
  at the end suspect libration matching precession and eccentricity goes up to ejection
  otherwise drift in is mostly dull

b1d  is restarted from b1 -s drift in
  low damping, drift out of eccentricity

c1 I ran a set up damping one at smaller semi-major axis 2.1
seed=4
 after I let this one run I can drift it out and look again at obliquity excitation.
 based on c1_old and b1c I think there could be obliquity excitation, particular
 for outward drift

    I had let it drift out with damping and copied result in c1_old

c1a: drift out restart of c1 -s
   low damp, obliquity jump
